# Rismose Java Course

This is a ~~private repo~~, public now bitch;

You literally **never** saw this, and I will slice your f*cking throat **:)**

## News `Update 2022-08-22`
### **I have recently been adding a bunch of documentation and comments in EVERY single existing class file to clarify what things do, why they are there, and what is going on.**
## Source

In this repo we have a ton of helpful classes for Java beginners, that explain certain things in Java.

Everything should be in the **`src`** folder. The rest of the files are **IntelliJ IDEA** project files

**CLASSES**

 **Main `Main.java`**
> Main class, where all methods are initialized.

**Variables `Variables.java`**
> Variables such as **`a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, etc.`** Stores the value of integers and Strings for example.

**Swap Variables `Swapvariable.java`**
> The art of swapping variable information using a temporary Variable **`(swapping x value to y using z)`**

**Strings `StringStuff.java`**
> A lot of information about Strings and what you can do with them. **`equals` `equalsIgnoreCase` `length` `charAt` `indexOf` `isEmpty` `toUpperCase` `toLowerCase` `trim` `replace`**

 **Expressions `Expressions.java`**
> Expressions such as **`+, -, *, /, %, ++, --, etc.`**

**GUI `GUI.java`**
> Simple use of the Swing graphical package for getting, storing and showing user input and messages in a graphical interface.

**Math `MathStuff.java`**
> Basic math introduction & calculating the hypotenuse of a right side triangle. Also using the **`Swing GUI`** to get user input.

**Random `RandomStuff.java`**
> Pseudo-random number generator between 1-5.

**Switches `Switches.java`**
> Using switches to compare for a value, instead of having to have a large tree of if-statements

**Input `Input.java`**
> The use of getting and storing user input via a Scanner.

**Logical Operators `LogicalOperators.java`**
> Using logical operators like **`&&, ||, !`** to check if-statements and case statements. Also using methods to infinitely run the program until the correct key or phrase is input.

**While Loops `WhileLoops.java`**
> Simple while loops and an example of a do-while loop.

**For Loops `ForLoops.java`**
> Simple for loops, and counting with delay.

**Nested Loops `NestedLoops.java`**
> Loops inside of loops. Creates a grid of your select character and size, while starting over after the grid has been displayed to you. Has support for continuing or breaking the loop with two separate methods with exception handling

**Arrays `Arrays.java`**
> Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Simple example of an array with 3 values & a for loop. Exception handling is used to catch errors.

**2D Arrays `Array2D.java`**
> 2D Arrays are arrays inside of arrays. Simple example of a 2D array with 3x rows 3x columns and a nested for loop.

**Wrapper Classes `WrapperClass.java`**
> Wrapper classes are used to store primitive data types in a class. Simple example with print statements.

**ArrayList `ArrayLists.java`**
> ArrayLists are used to store multiple values in a single variable. A collection that stores elements in an ordered list. Simple example of two arraylists with 4 - 5 values & a for loop.

**2D ArrayList `ArrayList2D.java`**
> 2D ArrayLists are ArrayLists inside of ArrayLists. Simple example of 3 ArrayLists with varying amounts of content inside another ArrayList.

### **The repo gets updated quite often.**

## What's coming next?
The next things to be added to the repo are:
> forEach-loop, methods, overloaded methods, and more.

## How to use the repo

In order to test out and use the classes in this repo you have to do a little setting-up.

 1. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java. I recommend **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)**, but you can also opt for **[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/)**

2. Once installed you have to set up a new project with a working environment. In this repo I have used **Java 8**, so anything newer than that would work (**Current version is Java 17**).

3. Then you can drop all the files from **`src`** into your  own **`src`** folder.

4. To then test out the different classes in the repo, it is very simple. Just head over into the **`Main.java`** class and un-comment the **method** for the **class** you want to test.

5. The file structure should look something like this.
