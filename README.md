# Rismose Java Course

This is a private repo, so if you see this and you are not;

  - `more ppl soon????`

You literally **never** saw this and I will slice your f*cking throat **:)**

## Source

In this repo we have a ton of helpful classes for Java beginners, that explain certain things in Java.

Everything should be in the **`src`** folder. The rest of the files are **IntelliJ IDEA** project files

**CLASSES**

 **Main `Main.java`**
> Main class, where all methods are initialized.

 **Expressions `Expressions.java`**
> Expressions such as `+, -, *, /, %, ++, --, etc.`

**GUI `GUI.java`**
> Simple use of the Swing graphical package for getting, storing and showing user input and messages in a graphical interface.

**Math `MathStuff.java`**
> Basic math introduction & calculating the hypotenuse of a right side triangle. Also using the `Swing GUI`

**Variables `Variables.java`**
> Variables such as `a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, etc.` Stores the value of integers and Strings for example.

**Swap Variables `Swapvariable.java`**
> The art of swapping variable information using a temporary Variable `(swapping x value to y using z)`

**Random `RandomStuff.java`**
> Psuedo-random number generator between 1-5.

**Switches `Switches.java`**
> Using switches to compare for a value, instead of having to have a large tree of if-statements

**Input `Input.java`**
> The use of getting and storing user input via a Scanner.

**Logical Operators `LogicalOperators.java`**
> Using logical operators like `&&, ||, !` to check if-satements and case satements. Also using methods to infinitely run the program until the correct key or phrase is input.

## How to use the repo

In order to test out and use the classes in this repo you have to do a little bit of set-up.

 1. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java. I recommend **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** but you can also opt for **[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/)**

2. Once installed you have to set up a new project with a working environment. In this repo I have used **Java 8**, so anything newer than that would work (**Current version is Java 17**).

3. Then you can drop all of the files from **`src`** into your  own **`src`** folder.

4. To then test out the different classes in the repo, it is very simple. Just head over into the **`Main.java`** class and un-comment the **method** for the **class** you want to test.

5. The file structure should look like this.
